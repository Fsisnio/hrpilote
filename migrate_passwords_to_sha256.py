"""
Migration script to re-hash existing user passwords with the new SHA-256 + bcrypt method.

This script updates all user passwords to use the new hashing method that supports
passwords of any length by pre-hashing with SHA-256 before bcrypt.

Note: This script requires users to log in again after migration, as we can't 
decrypt existing passwords. Instead, it will mark passwords for rehashing on next login.
Alternatively, you can run this to create a password reset requirement.
