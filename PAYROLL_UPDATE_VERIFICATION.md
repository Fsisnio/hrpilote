# üîç Payroll Update Verification Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you verify that the payroll update functionality is working correctly after the recent fixes.

## Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Backend server running on port 3003
- ‚úÖ Frontend server running on port 3000
- ‚úÖ API configuration updated to use port 3003

## Step-by-Step Verification

### 1. Access the Application
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000**
3. You should see the HR Pilot login page

### 2. Login with Test Credentials
- **Email**: `directadmin@hrpilot.com`
- **Password**: `adlin123`
- Click "Sign In"

### 3. Navigate to Payroll
1. Look for "Payroll" in the navigation menu
2. Click on "Payroll" to access the payroll management page
3. You should see a list of employee payroll records

### 4. Test the Edit Functionality

#### A. Open Edit Modal
1. Find any employee record in the payroll table
2. Click the **"Edit"** button (green button in the Actions column)
3. The edit modal should open with all salary components

#### B. Verify Current Values
Note down the current values:
- Basic Salary: $_______
- Housing Allowance: $_______
- Transport Allowance: $_______
- Medical Allowance: $_______
- Meal Allowance: $_______
- Loan Deduction: $_______
- Advance Deduction: $_______
- Uniform Deduction: $_______
- Parking Deduction: $_______
- Late Penalty: $_______
- **Net Salary (calculated)**: $_______

#### C. Update Values
Change the following values to test:
1. **Basic Salary**: Add 1000 to current value
2. **Housing Allowance**: Set to 500
3. **Transport Allowance**: Set to 300
4. **Medical Allowance**: Set to 200
5. **Meal Allowance**: Set to 150
6. **Loan Deduction**: Set to 100
7. **Advance Deduction**: Set to 50
8. **Uniform Deduction**: Set to 25
9. **Parking Deduction**: Set to 15
10. **Late Penalty**: Set to 0

#### D. Observe Real-time Calculation
- Watch the **"Net Salary"** field at the bottom of the modal
- It should update in real-time as you type
- Expected calculation: `(Basic Salary + Total Allowances) - Total Deductions`

### 5. Save and Verify Updates

#### A. Save Changes
1. Click **"Save Changes"** button
2. Modal should close
3. Success message should appear

#### B. Verify in Main Table
Check that the following values are updated in the main payroll table:
- ‚úÖ **Basic Salary** shows the new value
- ‚úÖ **Allowances** shows the sum of all allowances (500+300+200+150 = 1150)
- ‚úÖ **Deductions** shows the sum of all deductions (100+50+25+15+0 = 190)
- ‚úÖ **Net Salary** shows the calculated value (Basic + Allowances - Deductions)

### 6. Expected Results

#### Before the Fix (What was broken):
- ‚ùå Updated values wouldn't appear in the table
- ‚ùå Totals wouldn't compute correctly
- ‚ùå Net salary calculation would be wrong

#### After the Fix (What should work):
- ‚úÖ **Real-time calculation** in edit modal
- ‚úÖ **Updated values** appear immediately in main table
- ‚úÖ **Correct totals** for allowances and deductions
- ‚úÖ **Accurate net salary** calculation
- ‚úÖ **Data persistence** - values remain after page refresh

### 7. Verification Checklist
