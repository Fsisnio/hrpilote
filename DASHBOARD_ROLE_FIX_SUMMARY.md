# Dashboard Role-Based Display Fix

## Issue Identified
The user was seeing administrative metrics (Pending Requests, Approved This Month, Rejected This Month, Average Processing Time) that should not be visible to regular employees.

## Root Cause
The dashboard routing logic was incorrectly routing `UserRole.ORG_ADMIN` to the `EmployeeDashboard` instead of a proper admin dashboard.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New OrgAdminDashboard Component
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/dashboards/OrgAdminDashboard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Administrative metrics (Pending Requests, Approved This Month, Rejected This Month, Average Processing Time)
  - Employee overview (Total Employees, Active Employees, On Leave)
  - Admin management actions (Employee Management, Leave Management, Payroll, Reports)
  - Recent activity feed

### 2. Fixed Dashboard Routing Logic
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import for `OrgAdminDashboard`
  - Separated `UserRole.ORG_ADMIN` from `UserRole.EMPLOYEE` routing
  - Now `ORG_ADMIN` gets its own dedicated dashboard

### 3. Role-Based Dashboard Assignment
```typescript
switch (user.role) {
  case UserRole.SUPER_ADMIN:
    return <SuperAdminDashboard />;        // System-wide admin
    
  case UserRole.ORG_ADMIN:
    return <OrgAdminDashboard />;          // Organization admin (NEW)
    
  case UserRole.HR:
    return <HRDashboard />;                // HR management
    
  case UserRole.PAYROLL:
    return <PayrollDashboard />;           // Payroll management
    
  case UserRole.MANAGER:
  case UserRole.DIRECTOR:
    return <ManagerDashboard />;           // Team management
    
  case UserRole.EMPLOYEE:
  default:
    return <EmployeeDashboard />;          // Employee personal view
}
```

## Dashboard Content by Role

- ✅ Annual Leave Balance
- ✅ Sick Leave Balance  
- ✅ Hours This Week
- ✅ Clock In/Out functionality
- ✅ Personal leave requests
- ✅ Recent personal activity

### Org Admin Dashboard (NEW)
- ✅ Pending Requests
- ✅ Approved This Month
- ✅ Rejected This Month
- ✅ Average Processing Time
- ✅ Total Employees
- ✅ Active Employees
- ✅ On Leave Employees
- ✅ Employee Management
- ✅ Leave Management
- ✅ Payroll Management
- ✅ Reports Access

### HR Dashboard
- ✅ Total Employees
- ✅ Active Employees
- ✅ On Leave
- ✅ New Hires (30 days)
- ✅ Employee Records Management
- ✅ Leave Management
- ✅ HR Reports
- ✅ Training Management

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Check your user role in the system
2. If you have `EMPLOYEE` role: You should see personal metrics only
3. If you have `ORG_ADMIN` role: You should see administrative metrics
4. Refresh the dashboard page to see the correct content

## User Role Check
If you're still seeing administrative metrics, your user account might have `ORG_ADMIN` role instead of `EMPLOYEE` role. This would be correct behavior for an organization administrator.
