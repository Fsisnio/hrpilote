# Password Hashing Fix - SHA-256 + bcrypt Implementation

## Problem
The application was encountering errors when hashing passwords longer than 72 bytes due to bcrypt's inherent limitation:
```
password cannot be longer than 72 bytes, truncate manually if necessary
```

This was preventing user creation and causing 500 Internal Server errors.

## Solution
Implemented a **SHA-256 pre-hashing + bcrypt** approach, which is a security best practice for handling bcrypt's byte limitation.

### How It Works

1. **Pre-hashing with SHA-256**: Before passing passwords to bcrypt, they are first hashed with SHA-256
   - SHA-256 produces a fixed 32-byte digest regardless of input length
   - The digest is then base64-encoded to 44 characters
   - This ensures bcrypt always receives input well under the 72-byte limit

2. **Bcrypt for Security**: The SHA-256 hash is then passed to bcrypt for the final secure hashing
   - Maintains all the security benefits of bcrypt (salt, adaptive cost)
   - No security is compromised by this approach

### Security Considerations

✅ **This is a recommended pattern**: Pre-hashing with SHA-256 before bcrypt is documented in security best practices

✅ **Maintains security**: 
- SHA-256 is cryptographically secure
- bcrypt still provides protection against brute-force attacks
- Combined approach is as secure as bcrypt alone

✅ **Better than truncation**: Unlike truncating passwords, this approach uses the entire password in the hash

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`app/core/security.py`**
   - Added `_pre_hash_password()`: Pre-hashes passwords with SHA-256
   - Updated `get_password_hash()`: Uses SHA-256 + bcrypt for new hashes
   - Updated `verify_password()`: Tries new method first, falls back to old method for backward compatibility
   - Added `needs_password_rehash()`: Detects old-style hashes that need migration

2. **`app/api/v1/auth.py`**
   - Added automatic password rehashing on successful login
   - Users with old-style hashes are transparently migrated to new method

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **Existing users can still log in**: The system tries both old and new methods during verification

✅ **Automatic migration**: When a user with an old-style hash logs in:
   1. Their password is verified using the old method
   2. The system detects it needs rehashing
   3. Password is automatically re-hashed with the new method
   4. No user action required

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:

### Password Length Tests
- ✅ Short passwords (9 bytes)
- ✅ Medium passwords (54 bytes)
- ✅ Long passwords (104 bytes)
- ✅ Very long passwords (204 bytes) - **Previously failing**
- ✅ Unicode/emoji passwords (200 bytes)
- ✅ Extra long sentences (357 bytes)

### Backward Compatibility Tests
- ✅ Old-style hashes verify correctly
- ✅ Old-style hashes detected as needing rehashing
- ✅ New-style hashes verify correctly
- ✅ New-style hashes don't need rehashing

## Migration Guide

### For New Deployments
No action needed - new method is active automatically.

### For Existing Deployments
1. Deploy the updated code
2. Existing users can continue logging in normally
3. Users will be automatically migrated on their next login
4. Optionally run `migrate_passwords_to_sha256.py` to test the new hashing

### Testing the Fix
```bash
# Test password hashing with various lengths
./venv/bin/python test_password_fix.py

# Test the migration process
./venv/bin/python migrate_passwords_to_sha256.py
```

## Benefits

✅ **Supports any password length**: No more 72-byte limitation
✅ **Backward compatible**: Existing users unaffected
✅ **Automatic migration**: Users transparently upgraded on login
✅ **Security maintained**: No reduction in security
✅ **Industry standard**: Uses recommended best practices

## Technical Details

### Old Method (Previous Implementation)
```python
# Direct bcrypt hashing with truncation attempts
hashed = bcrypt.hash(password)  # Fails if password > 72 bytes
```

### New Method (Current Implementation)
```python
# SHA-256 pre-hashing + bcrypt
sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).digest()
base64_hash = base64.b64encode(sha256_hash).decode()  # 44 chars
hashed = bcrypt.hash(base64_hash)  # Always succeeds
```

## Verification Process

### For New Hashes
```
User Password → SHA-256 → Base64 → bcrypt.verify() → Success
```

### For Old Hashes (Backward Compatibility)
```
User Password → SHA-256 → Base64 → bcrypt.verify() → Fail
             → Direct bcrypt.verify() → Success → Auto-rehash
```

## Status

✅ **Implementation Complete**
✅ **All Tests Passing**
✅ **Production Ready**

The fix is active and passwords of any length can now be hashed successfully. Users with existing passwords will be automatically migrated on their next login.
